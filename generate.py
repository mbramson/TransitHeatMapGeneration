# The objective of this script is to generate a dataset that is the closest
# 20 stops for a list of addresses. The stops are public transportation stops,
# and the addresses are randomly distributed addresses throughout a city.
# The end goal of this dataset is to produce a heat map reflecting the
# accessibility of public transportation throughout the city.

# Method to Load in all Addresses from the Cuyahoga

# Method to Save the closest 20 Stops for each Address to an

# Method to loop through every address
